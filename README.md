Problem Statement: Many individuals struggle with managing their finances and budgeting their expenses, often leading to financial instability and stress. While there are various tools available online to calculate investments such as SIP, EMI, and FD, and track daily expenses such as rent and utilities, there is a need for a comprehensive website that combines both functionalities. The website should provide users with a range of financial calculators to make informed investment decisions, as well as a budget planner to track daily expenses and set limits for spending. Furthermore, the website should have an option to set income and allocate budgets for different expense categories. If the daily expenses exceed the set budget, the website should alert the user and suggest ways to control spending. Therefore, there is a need for a one-stop solution that combines financial calculators and budget planners to help individuals manage their finances effectively and achieve financial stability.
