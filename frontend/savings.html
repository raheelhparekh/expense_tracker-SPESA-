            <div class="habits">
                <h2>1. Build A Credit Score</h2>
                <p>Having a good credit score is not only important for qualifying for better interest rates when getting a loan — it also shows you have good money habits. Working on building and increasing your credit score can qualify you for lower interest rates on your credit card and finance charges and get you better rates on insurance
                You can still use your credit card if you use it wisely. Making sure to pay your bills in full on time, and billing fixed expenses to your credit card can help you build your credit score and get rewards.</p>

                <h2>2. Reduce Credit Cards Debt</h2>
                <p>A good money habit reduces your debt or yields a return. Together with building your credit score, lowering your credit card debt will also help lower interest fees paid each month. <br>
                Credit card debt can easily get out of hand when you’re using your credit card for most purchases, especially considering when you add incurred interest and finance charges.</p>

                <h2>3. Keep Track Of Your Net Worth</h2>
                <p>Your net worth is everything you own minus your debts. Staying updated with it, and understanding what it means can help you keep track of your progress and spending, and learn how to be better with money. Routinely looking at your liabilities (your debts) and making sure they don’t exceed your assets (money in your checking account, 401(k) and investments, owned cars, etc.) is a good money habit to start if you want to become more financially savvy.</p>

                    “Good money habits tend to have a positive effect on net worth by reducing liabilities or increasing the value of assets.” — Joe Dike, CPA/PFS, CFP, Mint Financial Coach

                <h2>4. Prioritise Your Student Loan Repayment</h2>
                <p>If you have student loans and you want to start building better money habits in the new year, it can be a good idea to start focusing on repaying those loans to avoid paying large amounts of interest and have peace of mind as an added bonus.

                Having student loans is nothing to be ashamed of, but take only what’s necessary.Warren Buffet mentioned that one of his biggest financial mistakes was taking out more student loans than he needed. “It was easy to justify because I had a young family I needed to take care of,” he said, “but we could have found more ways to sacrifice instead of having an extra debt load.”.</p>

                <h2>5. Start A Savings Plan</h2>
                <p>If you want to start building better money habits, stresses the importance of saving regularly. He mentions that it’s important to try to set aside an amount for savings from each paycheck. To make the process easier, Castella recommends having money automatically taken directly from your paycheck and directed to savings and investment accounts.  <br>

                    Now, if you already have a savings plan but want to increase it, Dike recommends systematic savings. In order to do that, he plans savings goals and establishes deadlines, then calculates the weekly or monthly amount needed to satisfy that goal and sets it on autopilot.</p>

                <h2>6. Buy Only What you need</h2>
                <p>If you find yourself spending money on unnecessary things, start a habit of taking some time to think before you buy and only buy what you need. Financial Coach Karen Layfield, CPA, always remembers her mother’s advice before buying anything: “It’s not a bargain if you don’t need it.” With that said, do your research and ask yourself if it’s something you actually need, or if it’s something you want. <br>

                    However, if it happens that you need to buy something, it can be a good idea to look for secondhand items. Keep in mind that you don’t have to go after the latest technology or clothes, and there are many secondhand options that can be as good for the environment as they can be for your wallet.</p>

                    “In terms of spending on things, I was taught to ‘Use it up. Wear it out. Make it do or do without.’” — Jared Smout, CPA, Mint Financial Coach

                <h2>7. Learn From Your Financial Mistakes</h2>
                <p>When trying to build better money habits, you will likely make mistakes. But if you want to have a better relationship with money, it’s important to learn from your errors. Even Mint Financial Coaches have made mistakes in the past, and shared their learnings with us.

                    As an example, Mandhana learned his lesson after losing $5,000 while currency trading on margin. He now stopped margin investing and became a buy-and-hold investor, which has been serving him well.  <br>

                <h2>8. Start Budgeting</h2>
                <p>Budgeting is key for developing better money habits. To avoid spending money beyond your budget — which Mandhana considers a bad money habit — it’s important to set boundaries, such as having a spending limit for your groceries, and keep track of your finances. <br>

                    There are many ways you can start budgeting your money, whether that’s through an app or trying out money-saving challenges, staying committed and finding what fits your lifestyle the best are the most important steps.</p>

                <h2>9. Sign up with budgeting apps</h2>
                <p>If you struggle with budgeting, there are many budgeting tools available to help you keep track of your finances. Signing up for a budgeting app, such as the Mint app, can help you get closer to your financial goals and start building better money habits. Routinely updating your budget on an app will help you evaluate your expenses better and make you think twice before spending.</p>

                <h2>10. Start Investing</h2>
                <p>Investing can open the doors to financial freedom, but if done poorly, it can take a toll on your finances. Mandhana advises that you shouldn’t invest in anything until you fully understand it. Take time to study investing and evaluate your budget before making that commitment. Whether you want to invest long-term or in cryptocurrency, make sure you’re in good financial standing and understand what you’re doing.</p>

                <h2>11. Keep an emergency fund</h2>
                <p>Emergencies can happen at any time and place, so being prepared ahead of time will make sure not to put a strain on your finances. Add to your emergency fund on a regular basis and reserve a chunk of your paycheck each month for your savings. Mandhana advises to always have adequate life insurance to cover your living expenses for 10 years, kids’ education, your mortgage, and other loan balances. <br>

                    Our experts understand that life can be complicated and unexpected — that’s why it’s a good habit to plan ahead for an emergency. Schule, for instance, suggests: “Try to forecast unexpected needs of relatives, such as parents and siblings. You might have to say no, but it feels a lot better to say yes.</p>
