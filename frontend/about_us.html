            <p>Our team is a group of young and enthusiastic developers who have implemented 
                this idea of an Expense Tracker to maintain a log of their expenditure and income. 
                We hope that this website will help you to keep track of your expenses and
                help you to manage your finances better.
                SPESA also includes various calculators to help you calculate your SIP, EMI, and FD returns.
                SPESA is an acronym for SPend-Earn-SAve
